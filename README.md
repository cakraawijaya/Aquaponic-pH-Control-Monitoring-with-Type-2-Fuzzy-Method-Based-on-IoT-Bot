# Aquaponic-pH-Control-Monitoring-with-Type-2-Fuzzy-Method-Based-on-IoT-Bot
<strong>Undergraduate Thesis Project Documentation (S1) - Informatics UPN Veteran Jatim</strong><br><br>
Aquaponic system is a combined farming system between fish with vegetables where the activities are mutually beneficial. On the other hand, crop failure can also be a concern for aquaponic farmers as this can happen at any time. Harvest failure can be influenced by many factors, but is usually caused by the high pH ambiguity of the water around the scope of cultivation. The aquaponic farmers are worried that if the crop failure continues it will have a negative impact on their food security. This project was created in the hope of solving the pH problem. This project has been carried out and took approximately 1 year. The system created can control and monitor changes in water pH at any time. This system is based on the Internet of Things (IoT), using MQTT as the communication protocol. This system is also equipped with artificial intelligence, which uses IT2FL (Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic) as its decision support. In addition, the system interface uses Telegram Bot, making it easier for users to interact.

##  pH Sensor Calibration
The pH sensor can be calibrated using the results of a linear regression calculation. You can see the linear regression equation as follows.

<table>
   <tr>
   <td width="40">I</td>
   <td width="800">

   $$\left(
   Y = a+b.X
   \right)$$
         
   </td>      
   </tr>
</table><br>

Explanation of the symbols in equation I, you can see more details in the following table.

<table>
   <tr height="50px">
      <th width="120">Symbol</th>
      <th width="720">Description</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ùëå</td>
      <td>pH buffer value</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ùëã</td>
      <td>voltage value obtained based on Y</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ùëé and ùëè</td>
      <td>linear regression determination value</td>
   </tr>
</table><br>

The linear regression determination values (a and b) can be obtained through equations II and III.

<table>
   <tr>
   <td width="40">II</td>
   <td width="800">
   
   $$\left(
    a = \frac{\sum Y.\sum X^{2}-\sum X.\sum XY}{n.\sum X^{2}-(\sum X)^{2}}
   \right)$$

   </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td width="40">III</td>
   <td width="800">
   
   $$\left(
    b = \frac{n.\sum XY-\sum X.\sum Y}{n.\sum X^{2}-(\sum X)^{2}}
   \right)$$

## RTC Sensor Calibration
This RTC sensor can be calibrated using the following program code :

```ino
#include <RTClib.h> // Calling the RTC library
RTC_DS3231 rtc; // Constructor

void setup(){
   RTCinit(); // Calling the RTCinit method
}

void loop(){}

void RTCinit(){
   // Starting up the RTC
   rtc.begin();

   // DateTime Setting
   rtc.adjust(DateTime(F(__DATE__), F(__TIME__)));

   // Set Time Now
   // If calibrated, please close with a comment
   rtc.adjust(DateTime(YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MM,SS));

<br><br>

## Disadvantages
1. Hardware:

   <table><tr><td width="810">
   
   ‚Ä¢ Electrical leakage current is caused by the use of non-standard PSU or the lack of insulators used.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Lack of air circulation in the main box can cause heat.
   
   ‚Ä¢ NO (Normally Open) applied to the relay causes the solenoid valve to become hot.
   
   ‚Ä¢ The lack of electric current causes the LCD to not power on.
   
   ‚Ä¢ The use of Arduino Uno as a filter or voltage divider is considered inefficient.
   
   ‚Ä¢ The pH sensor probe has no protection.
   
   </td></tr></table><br>

2. Firmware:

   <table><tr><td width="810">
   
   ‚Ä¢ The delay time in each method is considered excessive, it should use the ``` millis() ``` function so as not to interfere with other methods.

   ‚Ä¢ The use of ``` io-t.net ``` is considered not maximal because it is known that its use is just limited to ``` publish ```.

   ‚Ä¢ The security features on telegram bots are not good.

   </td></tr></table><br>

3. Others:

   <table><tr><td width="810">
   
   ‚Ä¢ Filling gallons of pH and giving AB Mix is still done manually, making it difficult for users.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Fish feeding is still done manually.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Pakcoy mustard greens lack regular sunlight intake, so after transplanting the land, its development is not as fast as before.

   ‚Ä¢ Draining and filling the aquarium water is still done manually, making it very inconvenient for users.

   </td></tr></table>

<br><br>

## Advantages
<table><tr><td width="840">
   
   ‚Ä¢ The system interface is through a telegram bot, so that giving orders as well as monitoring efforts can be done anytime and anywhere.
   
   ‚Ä¢ With IT2FL, the accuracy of the sensor becomes more accurate.

   ‚Ä¢ The system can automatically make its own decisions and can also be manually controlled by the user.
   
   ‚Ä¢ The system has been equipped with a timing feature.

</td></tr></table><br><br>

## In the Future
<table><tr><td width="840">
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for increased amperage. You can use a 3A PSU.

   ‚Ä¢ Need to change the NO (Normally Open) to NC (Normally Close) on the relays so that the electrified device can avoid damage.

   ‚Ä¢ Need for voltage and current sharing. You can use a step down.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for increased the security features of telegram bots.

   ‚Ä¢ Need for increased security on the pH sensor.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for the addition of pH tank re-fill devices and AB mix tanks that are made automatically.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for additional devices that can measure water temperature and ammonia.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for additional devices in automatic fish feeding.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for additional devices that can emit warm light as a substitute for sunlight.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for additional devices that can drain and fill aquarium water.
   
   ‚Ä¢ Need for additional devices that can optimally cool the main box. 
   
   ‚Ä¢ The existing hydroponic planting field in this study may need to be developed further in the future. In addition, rockwool planting media can be replaced with other planting media that are more adequate for plant needs, for example: husk charcoal or cocopeat.

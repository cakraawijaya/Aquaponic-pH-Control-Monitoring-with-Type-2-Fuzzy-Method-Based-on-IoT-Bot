# Aquaponic-pH-Control-Monitoring-with-Type-2-Fuzzy-Method-Based-on-IoT-Bot
<strong>Undergraduate Thesis Project Documentation (S1) - Informatics UPN Veteran Jatim</strong><br><br>
Aquaponic system is a combined farming system between fish with vegetables where the activities are mutually beneficial. On the other hand, crop failure can also be a concern for aquaponic farmers as this can happen at any time. Harvest failure can be influenced by many factors, but is usually caused by the high pH ambiguity of the water around the scope of cultivation. The aquaponic farmers are worried that if the crop failure continues it will have a negative impact on their food security. This project was created in the hope of solving the pH problem. This project has been carried out and took approximately 1 year. The system created can control and monitor changes in water pH at any time. This system is based on the Internet of Things (IoT), using MQTT as the communication protocol. This system is also equipped with artificial intelligence, which uses IT2FL (Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic) as its decision support. In addition, the system interface uses Telegram Bot, making it easier for users to interact.

##  pH Sensor Calibration
The pH sensor can be calibrated using the results of a linear regression calculation. You can see the linear regression equation as follows.

<table>
   <tr>
      <td width="40">I</td>
      <td width="800"><img height="30" width="120" src="https://github.com/devancakra/Aquaponic-pH-Control-Monitoring-with-Type-2-Fuzzy-Method-Based-on-IoT-Bot/assets/54527592/30303e06-fd2a-4e06-a7d2-911da8af041d" alt="Persamaan-I"></td>
   </tr>
</table><br>

Explanation of the symbols in equation I, you can see more details in the following table.

<table>
   <tr height="50px">

   <tr>
      <td>ùëå</td>
      <td>pH buffer value</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>ùëé and ùëè</td>
      <td>linear regression determination value</td>
   </tr>
</table><br>

The linear regression determination values (a and b) can be obtained through equations II and III.

## RTC Sensor Calibration
This RTC sensor can be calibrated using the following program code :

```ino
#include <RTClib.h> // Calling the RTC library
RTC_DS3231 rtc; // Constructor

void setup(){
   RTCinit(); // Calling the RTCinit method
}

void loop(){}

void RTCinit(){
   // Starting up the RTC
   rtc.begin();

   // DateTime Setting
   rtc.adjust(DateTime(F(__DATE__), F(__TIME__)));

   // Set Time Now
   rtc.adjust(DateTime(YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MM,SS));
}
```
